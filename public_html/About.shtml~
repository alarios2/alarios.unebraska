			<div class="entry">
				<p>Growing
up in the beautiful state of Washington, in what was then the small town of
Woodinville, near Seattle, I developed an appreciation for nature and a
fascination with its inner workings. My parents encouraged my
curiosity, and as far back as I can remember, I have tried to
understand more about the world we live in. I enjoy doing mathematics,
learning about science, programming, biking, hiking, 
cooking, reading, and spending time with my family and friends. I am
privileged to be able to spend much of my time working on research
that I find limitless fascination in. I am also lucky enough to be able to share my passion for mathematics with students through teaching and advising, which greatly enriches my life, and hopefully the lives of others.</p>

                <p>
I completed my B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics at Western Washington
University, where I also minored in physics.  I then completed my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of
California, Irvine under Professor Edriss S. Titi. I went on to complete a three-year visiting assistant professor (postdoc) position at Texas A&amp;M University under Professors Ciprian Foias and Jean-Luc Guermond. I began a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the mathematics department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the fall of 2014.<br />

       One of the great parts of being a mathematician, besides being able to work on great mathematics all day, is that mathematics is an international activity!  This means that working on mathematics gives you many opportunities to interact with people from all over the world.  Thanks to the generous support of others, I have been fortunate enough to be able to travel to many great places to talk about mathi.  I thought it might be fun to keep track of some of the places I have gone, so I marked some of the places on the map below in blue. Most of the travel to these places has been math-related.
