Lectures 24, 25, 32, 33, 35, 38, and 40.

* Basic iterative methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Siedel, SOR, SSOR) (SOR and SSOR were covered in *much* less detail)

* Convergence of some of these algorithms for diagonally dominant matrices

* The Fundamental Theorem of Iterative Methods (and the theorems leading up to it)

* Gershgorin theorems (I will give you the definition of the disks on the exam)

* Arnoldi/Krylov techniques (you should know what a Krylov subspace is and what Arnoldi does, but there is no need to memorize algorithms)

* Variational/minimization methods: Steepest Decent (SD), Conjugate Gradient (CG), and GMRES (Understand the proofs, but don't memorize the algorithms)

* Preconditioning (just the main ideas, we didn't go into much detail here)

* Eigenvalue problems and classical eigenvalue algorithms (we didn't have homework on this, so if it appears on the exam, it will only be over what we discussed in class)
